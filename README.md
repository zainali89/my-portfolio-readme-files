Hello, I hope you are fine. 

Thank you for considering my application. I'm an experienced Go High Level and Zapier expert with a strong background in WordPress development. I have 4 years of development and integration experience. Here's how I can help:

I will set up email automations, tags, segments, and onboarding processes using Go High Level. I'll white label GHL, build funnels, integrate payment gateways, and set up memberships. I will design and optimize checkout and landing pages, set up email campaigns, and configure triggers. With Zapier, I'll integrate and connect apps to streamline workflows and automate processes.

I have recently worked on similar projects, including integrating a CMS with Zapier and Mailchimp for automated email campaigns, ensuring timely updates for subscribers. I also have extensive experience in customizing WordPress themes and plugins, implementing appointment scheduling, and ensuring seamless website functionality.

I have recorded a video which shows my skills and proposal for this job. Here is the URL to the video: https://komododecks.com/recordings/V810oMYs4NlxxZnquLFU

I would like to show you my recent development in the similar projects.
